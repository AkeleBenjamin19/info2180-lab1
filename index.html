<p>I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am currently engaging in a few  extracurricular activities such as football and track and field. I hope by the end of my university tenure I will become a well rounded individual in society. I am interested in Web Development because I would like to learn HTmL and be more familiar with GitHub. </p>
